dotnet/runtime,1bfcb853a3444b5c6011dede2631f77ebb7e660e,"Handle 'lib' variants in ModuleNameVariations to generate DirectPInvokes (#118285)

In ILC, when a DirectPInvokes item was prefixed with 'lib', it wouldn't recognize the library and wouldn't generate a direct pinvoke. There are a lot of places within the repo (and I assume other codebases) that use the 'lib' prefix in DirectPInvokes, so it seems to make more sense to handle that case rather than remove the prefix from all usages.

This accounts for the scenario with `[DllImport(""libMyLibrary"")]` and `--directpinvoke MyLibrary`, but not the scenario with `[DllImport(""MyLibrary"")]` and `--directpinvoke:libMyLibrary`.

For native AOT we [document](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/native-aot/optimizing) three build modes: a blended default, optimized for size, and optimized for speed.

Typically, optimize for speed is needed to get as closed as possible to CoreCLR-JIT performance (e.g. optimize for speed is the only mode that enables Tier-1 inliner in the JIT). The blended default gets close, but this gives an extra percent or two in throughput at the cost of more size.

The VXSort code and table costs 115,712 bytes.

We currently compile with VXSort enabled in blended mode and optimize for speed. We link out VXSort when optimizing for size. Maybe this is not something that should be part of the blended default.

* When you do `dotnet new console --aot` and `dotnet publish` the hello world, 11% of the output binary is VXSort (!)
* Even in more significant apps (e.g. a simple Kestrel host), VxSort is still a single-digit percentage of the app.
* I was not able to measure improvement with VxSort on real world apps that I tried (native AOT compiled ILC, benchmarks we use in ASP.NET labs).

I'm leaning towards disabling this on blended builds.

Our default guidance if someone is not happy with native AOT TP is to switch to Speed optimized builds, so if there's a problem because of this being off, our default guidance would resolve this right away without even having to profile and root cause the problem to sorting. I think using VxSort in the Speed optimization mode only is the right default.",3,13,6,"handle 'lib' variants in modulenamevariations to generate directpinvokes (issue_ref)in ilc, when a directpinvokes item was prefixed with 'lib', it wouldn't recognize the library and wouldn't generate a direct pinvoke. there are a lot of places within the repo (and i assume other codebases) that use the 'lib' prefix in directpinvokes, so it seems to make more sense to handle that case rather than remove the prefix from all usages.this accounts for the scenario with and , but not the scenario with and ."

Long-running enumerator loops at Tier0+instr will see their executions
transition over to a non-instrumented OSR version of the code.

This can cause loss of PGO data in the portions of the method that
execute after the leaving the loop that inspires OSR.

For enumerator vars we can safely deduce the likely classes from
probes made earlier in the method. So when we see a class profile

dotnet/runtime,c993ba2ee63e7e917d18e10d3f90067864047321,"JIT: Refine asserts for RMW check in crc32 and hw intrinsic codegen (#108750)

The crc32 HW intrinsic is a 2 operand node that produces a register; however,
the underlying instruction is an RMW instruction that destructively modifies
`op1`. For that reason the codegen needs to issue a move of op1 into the target
register before `crc32` is issued.

There is an assert that this `mov` does not overwrite op2 in the process. When
LSRA builds uses for the operands it needs to mark op2 as delay freed to ensure
op2 and the target do not end up in the same register. However, due to
optimizations LSRA may skip this marking when op1 is a last use. Thus we can end
up hitting the assert.

The most logical solution seems to be to actually ensure that op2 is always
delay freed, such that it never shares the register with the target. However,
the handling for other RMW nodes (like `GT_SUB`) does not have similar logic to
this; instead it relies on the situation to not happen except for one particular
case where it is ok: when `op1` and `op2` are actually the same local. This PR
enhances the assert to match the checks that happen for other RMW nodes.

Adds a project to run a NativeAOT shared library on Android.

The android test builds a single native library that exports the methods that are expected by the monodroid tests (InitRuntime, SetEnv, ExecEntryPoint, FreeUnmanagedResources). JNI struct definitions are copied to get arg strings from the JNIEnv object.

ApkBuilder no longer needs to compile the monodroid native library, but it does need to add the .jar from the cryptography library to the apk bundle in order to run crypto operations.

Build targets were updated to account for the new NativeAOT tests, and a new job was added for NativeAOT on android tests.

C++/CLI appears to leave the CORINFO_EH_CLAUSE ClassToken/FilterOffset union
set to some nonzero value for fault/filter clauses. The JIT currently just
passes this value along to the runtime.

If a method with such a nonzero field is inlined into a dynamic method, this
trips up a check in the runtime where a nonzero entry for such a field is
interpreted as a class handle, even for fault/filter clauses where it should
be ignored.

Tolerate this by zeroing the field in the JIT and ignoring this field
in the runtime/crossgen2 for finally/filter clauses.

Note this could not have happened in pre .NET10 as methods
with EH could not be inlined, so a dynamic method would never see such
an EH clause, and in non-dynamic methods this field is ignored for
faults and filters.

dotnet/runtime,7bc40a5a0a29411981e64733b803f7a16fedbd86,"Improve OpenSSL digest performance

In OpenSSL 1.x, hash algorithm functions like EVP_sha256 are basically static variable lookups to a function table, making them fairly efficient.

OpenSSL 3 however, has a different model for this. OpenSSL 3 instead has a fetch mechanism using EVP_fetch which is the preferred mechanism for ""get me an EVP_MD"". This is called an explicit fetch. For compatibility, the old OpenSSL 1.x functions were kept, however instead of EVP_sha256 being a simple ""get me this variable's value"" it returns a shim that does EVP_sha256 for you, ever time it is used. This is called an implicit fetch.

The OpenSSL documentation recommends using explicit fetching, and memoizing the value yourself. https://docs.openssl.org/master/man7/ossl-guide-libcrypto-introduction/#performance

This has worthwhile performance benefits. For ""single block"" inputs in to the hash algorithm, this reduces the call time by 200-300ns. That can be anywhere from a 25% to 33% reduction for empty and a couple of blocks of input data.

Even though we memoize the value over on the managed side in the HashAlgorithmDispenser, this memorization only really avoids the p/invoke boundary. What is actually getting memoized is a lookup function (more or less)",2025-08-13 14:36:55+00:00,Kevin Jones,0,,,1,57,115,"improve openssl digest performancein openssl 1.x, hash algorithm functions like evp_sha256 are basically static variable lookups to a function table, making them fairly efficient.openssl 3 however, has a different model for this. openssl 3 instead has a fetch mechanism using evp_fetch which is the preferred mechanism for ""get me an evp_md"". this is called an explicit fetch. for compatibility, the old openssl 1.x functions were kept, however instead of evp_sha256 being a simple ""get me this variable's value"" it returns a shim that does evp_sha256 for you, ever time it is used. this is called an implicit fetch.the openssl documentation recommends using explicit fetching, and memoizing the value yourself. #performancethis has worthwhile performance benefits. for ""single block"" inputs in to the hash algorithm, this reduces the call time by 200-300ns. that can be anywhere from a 25% to 33% reduction for empty and a couple of blocks of input data.even though we memoize the value over on the managed side in the hashalgorithmdispenser, this memorization only really avoids the p/invoke boundary. what is actually getting memoized is a lookup function (more or less)"

Currently, when resolving RID-agnostic assets from an application itself (that is, those in the app's .deps.json), any subdirectory specified in the file path is ignored. We just take the file name and expect it to be next to the .deps.json.

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/117682 added an optional `localPath` property for assets. If set, this represents the path on disk relative to the .deps.json. This change updates the host to consume that property. When resolving assets from an application itself:
1. `localPath` property is set: use `<deps_dir>/<localPath>`
2. asset is from a runtimepack: use `<deps_dir>/<file_path>`
    - runtimepack assets are always generated with the actual destination path in the file path
3. otherwise (this is the existing behaviour):
    - RID-specific assets: use `<deps_dir>/<file_path>`
    - RID-agnostic assets:
      - runtime: take only the file name, use `<deps_dir>/<file_name>`
      - resources: take parent directory name of the file path, use `<deps_dir>/<dir_name>/<file_name>`

With this change, usage of app-relative .NET search, and some msbuild hackery, it is possible to publish a self-contained application and stick the runtimepack in a subdirectory:
```xml

    <ReferenceCopyLocalPaths Remove=""@(RuntimePackAsset)"" />
    <ReferenceCopyLocalPaths Include=""@(RuntimePackAsset)"" />
  </ItemGroup>

We currently ignore invalid global.json, which can lead to unexpected/undesired behaviour. While we're not going to change that behaviour right now, this change adds some indication about this situation in `dotnet --info` and updates a `hostfxr` API to indicate if an invalid global.json was found.

- Make `sdk_resolver` track/store information about global.json even when it is deemed invalid
- Update `dotnet --info` to list invalid global.json file path and error message
- Add `hostfxr_resolve_sdk2_result_key_t::global_json_state` for `hostfxr_resolve_sdk2` API
  - string values of: `not_found`, `valid`, `invalid_json`, `invalid_data`
  - This can be used in the SDK to add telemetry for when we have invalid global.json

```

## Summary

Multiple classes across the repository were throwing
`IndexOutOfRangeException` with `nameof(index)` as the message
parameter, resulting in an unhelpful error message of just ""index""
instead of the standard .NET exception message.

## Changes

This PR updates all occurrences to use the parameterless
`IndexOutOfRangeException()` constructor, which provides the default,
user-friendly message: ""Index was outside the bounds of the array.""

**Before:**
```csharp
throw new IndexOutOfRangeException(nameof(index));
// Exception message: ""index""
```

**After:**
```csharp
throw new IndexOutOfRangeException();
// Exception message: ""Index was outside the bounds of the array.""
```

## Files Modified

**Logging-related files:**
- **LoggerMessage.cs**: Fixed 7 occurrences across different generic
`LogValues<T>` classes
- **LoggerMessageGenerator.Emitter.cs**: Fixed 1 occurrence in the
source generator template
- **LogValuesFormatter.cs**: Fixed 1 occurrence in the logging formatter
- **FormattedLogValues.cs**: Fixed 1 occurrence in formatted log values
- **LoggerExtensionsTest.cs**: Fixed 1 occurrence in test helper class
- **HttpHeadersLogValue.cs**: Fixed 1 occurrence in HTTP logging
infrastructure
- **Baseline test files**: Updated 3 generated code baseline files to
match the new output
- **LoggerMessageTest.cs**: Added comprehensive test to verify the
exception message is proper

**Other components:**
- **DesignerOptionService.cs**: Fixed 1 occurrence in
System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter

## Testing

- All existing tests continue to pass (291 tests in
Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Tests, 184 tests in
Microsoft.Extensions.Http.Tests)
- Added new test
`LogValues_OutOfRangeAccess_ThrowsIndexOutOfRangeExceptionWithDefaultMessage`
that validates the exception message for all LogValues variants (0-6
parameters)
- Manually verified the fix produces the expected error message

This is a minimal change that maintains backward compatibility (still
throws `IndexOutOfRangeException`) while significantly improving the
developer experience with a clear, descriptive error message across the
entire codebase.

A couple times in the past I needed a way to say ""if X is not part of the program, eliminate the entire basic block"". We can do this for allocated types (this is how branches under `is` checks elimination works), but we can't do this for more general ""characteristics"".

This introduces a mechanism where AOT compiler and CoreLib (or System.Private.* universe in general) can define whole program tags such as ""whole program has X in it"" and CoreLib can condition code on the presence of this tag.

This is easier shown than described, so I extracted the first use of this into a separate commit. In this commit, we eliminate code that tries looking for `StackTraceHiddenAttribute` if we know the whole program has no `StackTraceHiddenAttribute` in it. With this code eliminated, #118640 can then eliminate all custom attributes on methods, which in turn plays into #118718 and we can eliminate enum boxing even when StackTraceSupport is not set to false (right now #118718 really needs the StackTraceSupport=false to get rid of boxed enums; we get more boxed enums from method attributes).

We have a new node that represents the characteristic. The node can be dropped into the graph wherever needed.

C++/CLI appears to leave the CORINFO_EH_CLAUSE ClassToken/FilterOffset union
set to some nonzero value for fault/filter clauses. The JIT currently just
passes this value along to the runtime.

If a method with such a nonzero field is inlined into a dynamic method, this
trips up a check in the runtime where a nonzero entry for such a field is
interpreted as a class handle, even for fault/filter clauses where it should
be ignored.

Tolerate this by zeroing the field in the JIT and ignoring this field
in the runtime/crossgen2 for finally/filter clauses.

Note this could not have happened in pre .NET10 as methods
with EH could not be inlined, so a dynamic method would never see such
an EH clause, and in non-dynamic methods this field is ignored for
faults and filters.

In debug codegen we expect basic blocks to have valid start IL offsets,
potentially to an invalid IL end offset.

When we split a block at a node, we find the end offset by looking
backwards from that node for an `IL_OFFSET` node. If we find such a
node, we use it as the split point IL offset. Otherwise we use
`BAD_IL_OFFSET` and start the next block at the end offset (making it
have a 0 byte range).

This latter behavior is problematic if the bottom portion of the split
has its own `IL_OFFSET` nodes. In that case we can end up with
`IL_OFFSET` nodes pointing outside the region of the basic block. If we
later split again, then we can end up creating illegal IL offset ranges
for unoptimized code. In an example case we first ended up with the
bottom block having an IL offset range of `[0aa..0aa)` but still
containing an `IL_OFFSET` with an offset of `092`. When we later split
the bottom block again we ended up with `[0aa..0aa), [092..0aa)` and hit
an assert.

To address the problem change the behavior in the following way:
* If we find no `IL_OFFSET` node in the upper block, then look for one
in the lower block, and use its value as the split point
* If we find no `IL_OFFSET` in both blocks then consider the lower block
empty and the upper block to have everything (same behavior as before).
* One exception to above: if the end was already `BAD_IL_OFFSET` then we
have to consider the upper block to be empty as we cannot represent the
other case

This fixes #119616. However for that specific case, which is inside
async code, we will have the exact IL offset of the async call we are
splitting at after #120303, so we will be able to do better. I'll make
that change as part of that PR.",48,1153,2668,updating the managed baselines to and (issue_ref)* updating the managed baselines to x86-64-v2 and armv8.1-a* fix parens on macos* fix a check that's necessary for 64-bit* don't require feat_lse on linux* remove the legacy encoding for pextrw* fix a pre-initialization smoke test to account for popcnt now being pre-initialized* update the r2r baseline to differ from the naot baseline* have the preinitialization smoke test use an isa that is opportunistic with the new baseline* don't target x86-64-v3 for osx to avoid negatively impacting apple silicon* ensure the rcpc2 check is done last so methods aren't marked as using it unnecessarily* ensure containment for ssse3.shuffle still works* ensure avx only hardware doesn't assert during lowering* don't run the jittedmethodscountingtest if the default target is disabled

The code of a compiled method can use data items that contain InterpMethod* pointers. Because at the moment when a method is compiled these referenced interp methods weren't yet tiered up, we will register these data item locations to the tiering backend so that, when they do get tiered up, the locations get updated with the new InterpMethod* reference. At this moment of compilation time, we could race with other compilers of the same InterpMethod so we could end up registering redundant data_items (only the data_items for the method winning the race will actually end up being used by the executing interpreter code). Normally this is harmless, we just patch some data that never gets used.

The problems start when we free interpreter methods. When the interp method is freed, we need to clear the patch_sites_table of any locations pointing into this method's data items. We do a search starting from the data items of this method. Because we have no way to reference the wrongly registered data items, these entries will stay alive in the table. As the memory gets reused, these entries will point into other runtime code, and when the get patched, it will result in corruption of memory.

because compressed integers are specified by having their upper bit set,

* Fix issues with interpreted EH

The exception handling with interpreter enabled was not working properly
when the managed code exception handling code was interpreted too. There
were couple of places where we try to unwind to the first managed frame
using native unwind that obviously doesn't work for fully interpreted
code.
There is also an assert in the ExceptionHandling.cs that checks sanity
of the handling frame SP, but it assumes that managed locals are stored on
the processor stack. This is not the case for interpreted code.

This change fixes those places, namely:
* Updating floating point registers for Frames. It now unwinds upto a
  specific SP instead of searching for managed frame except for
  InlinedCallFrame case when that frame is in JIT/AOT code.
* Resuming after catch is fixed and also simplified a lot.
* Disable the sanity assert when runtime is compiled with interpreter. I
  don't think there is much value in that assert.

It also enables two pinvoke tests that were fixed in the past already,
but not enabled yet.

Fixes automatic stream positioning issue when using compression streams
with mixed-content data.

When using `DeflateStream`, `GZipStream`, `ZLibStream` or `BrotliStream`
for decompression, the underlying stream position would advance past the
end of compressed data due to internal buffering. This caused issues
when reading additional content after decompression in mixed-format
files.

- Added automatic stream rewinding when decompression completes and the
underlying stream supports seeking
- The stream is now rewound to the exact end of compressed data by
seeking back by the number of unconsumed bytes in the inflater/decoder
buffer
- Added `_decompressionFinished` flag to ensure rewinding happens only
once, even with multiple Read/ReadAsync/CopyTo calls after decompression
completes
- Added new tests to verify stream rewinding behavior and prevention of
multiple rewinds

Fixes #73770

dotnet/runtime,541ac3eae8dc32c76211fed52ab501de038fcdca,"Propagate DynamicallyAccessedMembers annotations to auto-properties only (#119329)

In the trimmer and ILC, we searched for backing fields with heuristics that validated a backing field had a `CompilerGeneratedAttribute`. In C# 14, the `field` keyword / semi-auto property feature means that some properties will have a compiler-generated field, but a user-written accessor. This can cause holes and unexpected behavior with the current heuristics. The semi-auto property accessors do not have `CompilerGeneratedAttribute`, so we can tighten the heuristic to only find backing fields when all accessors _and_ the found backing field have `CompilerGeneratedAttribute`. This should apply backing field propagation heuristics to properties with at least one auto accessor (e.g. `int Prop { get => field; set; }`) only (and also warns when it is unable to find the backing field for these). For all other properties, it is possible to annotate the backing field and accessors to achieve the same behavior.

- It turns out that the GCEncoder ignores information about tracked locals unless there is at least 1 interruptible range
- Fixing that made it clear that the current reporting strategy of using accurate reporting for those ranges wasn't correct, so instead I've enabled the conservative logic within the GC, and am now GC reporting temporary vars/call arguments via the conservative reportiung strategy.
  - Notably, the liveness analysis for local variables in the interpreter results in overlapping live ranges.
  - And arguments passed to called functions are still reporting the call arguments as well as the called function.
- Fix issue where interpreter GC stack reporting was hitting code that did comparisons against the SP pointer. We shouldn't be doing that in any situation, so use template goo to remove that from the interpreter variant of the gc info
- `InterpreterCodeManager::GetInstance` and `InterpreterCodeManager::GetParamTypeArg` needed to assume that only the SP was valid in the REGDISPLAY. Previously we used the FP to get at the values, but that isn't reliably useable during collided EH unwind first pass processing
- Tweak the behavior of `PushStackType` in the interpreter compiler so that it works correctly for pushing a value type onto the stack. This broke our implementation of mkrefany.

- Implement this by making a shadow copy of the this pointer in this situation
- To avoid doing this ALL of the time, I've added a scheme where we can restart the entire method compilation by setting a flag which describes the current set of retry rules.

* [clr-interp] allow modification of the this pointer in functions which use it as the generics context
- When the this pointer is used as the generics context, if some code modifies the this pointer, do not allow that modification to affect the generics behavior of the function
- Implement this by making a shadow copy of the this pointer in this situation
- To avoid doing this ALL of the time, I've added a scheme where we can restart the entire method compilation by setting a flag which describes the current set of retry rules.

## Summary: Remove Socket.SendFile and SendFileAsync 2GB limitation on
Windows

### Problem
On Windows, the `Socket.SendFile` and `Socket.SendFileAsync` APIs were
limited to sending files up to `int.MaxValue` (2GB) due to the Win32
`TransmitFile` and `TransmitPackets` functions' `int
numberOfBytesToWrite` parameter. This limitation did not exist on
Linux/macOS. The issue has been tracked as
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/42534.

### Solution
Implemented automatic partitioning of large file sends into multiple
`TransmitFile` calls (for synchronous SendFile) and multiple
`SendPacketsElement` entries (for asynchronous SendFileAsync) when the
file exceeds 2GB, as suggested by the TransmitFile Win32 API
documentation. The implementation is optimized to minimize syscalls by
combining pre/post buffers with file chunks.

### Implementation Details

**Modified: `SocketPal.Windows.cs::SendFile` (Synchronous)**
- Detect files larger than `int.MaxValue` using `RandomAccess.GetLength`
- For large files:
1. Separate behavior flags (WriteBehind, UseSystemThread, UseKernelApc)
from terminal flags (Disconnect, ReuseSocket)
2. Apply behavior flags to all operations for consistent performance
characteristics
  3. Loop through file in `int.MaxValue`-sized chunks:
     - First chunk includes preBuffer (if present) to minimize syscalls
     - Intermediate chunks send only file data
     - Last chunk includes postBuffer (if present) and terminal flags
     - TransmitFile automatically advances file pointer between chunks
- For small files (≤ 2GB), use original single `TransmitFile` call

**Modified: `SocketAsyncEventArgs.Windows.cs::DoOperationSendPackets`
(Asynchronous)**
- After opening file handles, check if any files exceed `int.MaxValue`
bytes using `RandomAccess.GetLength`
- For large files on Windows:
1. Dynamically expand the `SendPacketsElement[]` array to accommodate
partitioning
2. Create multiple `SendPacketsElement` entries for each large file,
each with offset and count
  3. Each packet handles up to `int.MaxValue` bytes
  4. Properly set endOfPacket flag on the last element
- This approach ensures file length is checked AFTER the file handle is
opened, preventing race conditions where file size could change between
length check and send operation
- For small files, use original single `SendPacketsElement`

**Modified: `Socket.Tasks.cs::SendFileAsync`**
- Maintains original simple implementation without early file length
checking
- Partitioning is handled in `DoOperationSendPackets` after files are
opened

**Modified: `TransmitFileHelper`**
- Added optional `numberOfBytesToWrite` parameter (defaults to 0 for
""send entire file"")
- Preserves existing behavior for all current callers

**Modified: `System.Net.Sockets.csproj`**
- Added `Interop.SetFilePointerEx.cs` to project references

**Modified: `SendFile.cs` tests**
- Removed `[ActiveIssue]` attribute from
`GreaterThan2GBFile_SendsAllBytes` test

### Performance Optimizations
- PreBuffer is combined with the first file chunk, avoiding a separate
syscall
- PostBuffer is combined with the last file chunk, avoiding a separate
syscall
- TransmitFile's automatic file pointer advancement eliminates need for
manual file seeking
- For a file just over 2GB: only 2 TransmitFile/TransmitPackets calls
needed (first chunk with preBuffer + last chunk with postBuffer) instead
of 4 separate calls

### Race Condition Prevention
- File length is checked AFTER the file handle is opened in
`DoOperationSendPackets`
- This prevents race conditions where file size could change between
length check and actual send operation
- Ensures accurate partitioning based on the actual file state at send
time

### Testing
- ✅ Code compiles successfully on all platforms
- ✅ All 154 existing SendFile tests pass on Linux (Unix implementation
unchanged)
- ✅ Fixed asynchronous SendFileAsync to handle files > 2GB without race
conditions
- ⏳ Windows CI will validate the fix for files > 2GB

### Changes
- [x] Analyze the current implementation
- [x] Modify `SocketPal.Windows.cs` to partition large file sends
(synchronous)
- [x] Modify `SocketAsyncEventArgs.Windows.cs` to partition large file
sends (asynchronous)
- [x] Update `TransmitFileHelper` to accept numberOfBytesToWrite
parameter
- [x] Add loop to send file in chunks when size > int.MaxValue
- [x] Add SetFilePointerEx interop to System.Net.Sockets.csproj
- [x] Handle behavior and terminal flags correctly for large files
- [x] Optimize to combine preBuffer/postBuffer with file chunks
- [x] Remove ActiveIssue attribute from GreaterThan2GBFile test
- [x] Fix race condition by checking file length after opening file
handle
- [x] Verify code compiles successfully
- [x] Validate existing tests pass on Linux

> On Windows, the Socket.{Begin}SendFile API inherits the limitation of
the Win32 TransmitFile function that constraints it to only being able
to send int.MaxValue bytes; anything larger results in an error. This is
not a regression, but we should consider supporting this by manually
partitioning as the TransmitFile docs suggest. This already works on
Linux and macOS.</issue_description>

## Summary

Successfully updated Regex named blocks from Unicode 4.0 to Unicode
17.0:
- **Added 59 new Unicode blocks** including Arabic Extended-A/B,
Balinese, Bamum, Cherokee Supplement, Cyrillic Extended-A/B/C,
Devanagari Extended, Georgian Extended, Hangul Jamo Extended-A/B,
Javanese, Kayah Li, Latin Extended-C/D/E, and many more
- **Maintained full backward compatibility** by:
  - Keeping IsGreek as alias for IsGreekandCoptic
- Restoring all previously removed blocks (IsCombiningMarksforSymbols,
IsHighPrivateUseSurrogates, IsHighSurrogates, IsLowSurrogates,
IsPrivateUse, IsPrivateUseArea)
  - Maintaining correct alphabetical ordering
  - Preserving original block values (e.g., IsSpecials)
  - Maintaining test coverage for all blocks
- **Created GenRegexNamedBlocks tool** for easy future Unicode updates
with full documentation
- **Total named blocks: 167** (increased from 108)
- **No breaking changes** - all existing block names remain available
with correct values
- **Unicode 17.0**: Verified that Unicode 17.0 has the same BMP blocks
as 16.0, ensuring complete coverage of the latest Unicode standard
- **Updated Unicode update instructions**: Added the GenRegexNamedBlocks
tool to the official Unicode update process documentation in
`Updating-Unicode-Versions.md`
- **Automated table generation**: Moved s_propTable to a generated file
(RegexCharClass.Tables.cs) that is automatically created by the
GenRegexNamedBlocks tool, eliminating the need for manual updates
- **Added to all projects**: Included RegexCharClass.Tables.cs in both
the main library project and the source generator project

The changes enable .NET developers to use regular expressions with
up-to-date Unicode block names while maintaining complete backward
compatibility. Future Unicode updates will now be fully automated
through the GenRegexNamedBlocks tool.

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/119113 by adding a new

The warning is also produced by ILLink and ILC, but only when the

assembly is rooted. So in practice this will be caught just by the
analyzer.

See comments in the code that explain some nuances of the test
approach (we need a way to assert `ExpectedWarning`s on the extension
properties, but not the compiler-generated methods in the extension
metadata type).

If we are doing an optimized+instrumented jit pass (like we do for R2R methods)
allow the inlinees to be instrumented. This gives us a chance to collect profile
data for methods that are always inlined.

All inlinees currently share the same profile data segment with each other and
with a root compilation of the method (if any). So this profile is ""context-free"".

If there is a schema mismatch (say there is a stale pre-existing R2R schema) then
subsequent instrumentation will fail. This is something we need to keep an eye on.
Right now we can't distinguish this failure from other kinds of schema allocation
failures.

Context: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION#SDK_INT_FULL

Android 16 Quarterly Platform Release 2 (QPR2) Beta 2 has been released.

Android 16 QPR2 adds a new concept, ""minor"" SDK versions:

    > The new [`SDK_INT_FULL`][0] constant can be used for API checks…
    >
    >     if (SDK_INT_FULL >= VERSION_CODES_FULL.[MAJOR or MINOR RELEASE]) {
    >       // Use APIs introduced in a major or minor release
    >     }
    >
    > You can also use the [`Build.getMinorSdkVersion()`][1] method to
    > get just the minor SDK version:
    >
    >     minorSdkVersion = Build.getMinorSdkVersion(Build.VERSION_CODES_FULL.BAKLAVA);

To mirror this in .NET, we introduced a new `$(TargetFramework)` such as
`net10.0-android36.1` where C# developers could use:

    if (OperatingSystem.IsAndroidVersionAtLeast(36, 1))
    {
        // Use APIs introduced in Android 36.1
    }

Reviewing Android's implementation of `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT_FULL` we
can check the `ro.build.version.sdk_full` system property to get the
minor version and falling back to `ro.build.version.sdk` otherwise.

`libSystem.Native.so` can return the value from
`SystemNative_GetUnixRelease()` making both `Environment.OSVersion`
and `System.IsAndroidVersionAtLeast()` support minor Android releases.

An example of the system properties available on the latest emulator:

    % adb shell getprop | grep ro.build.version.sdk
    [ro.build.version.sdk]: [36]
    [ro.build.version.sdk_full]: [36.1]

The release notes mention QPR2 Beta 2 is API stable, so we should be
safe to rely on this behavior going forward:

> QPR2 Beta 2 is now available and has released Platform Stability.
> That means that the API surface is locked, and the app-facing behaviors
> are final, so you can incorporate them into your apps and take advantage
> of our latest platform innovations.

To test this behavior, I set `$DOTNET_ANDROID_VERSION_FROM_JAVA` in the
Android test runner, to verify we get the same value from Java and .NET.

* Removed test changes, to be added in dotnet/android instead.

Tests were originally useful to test the new code works:

The previous IL generated approximately implements the following:
```csharp
ExecutionAndSyncBlockStore store = default;
store.Push();
Continuation cont = null;
T result = default;
try
{
  try
  {
    result = Inner(args);

if (cont == null)

However, since `FinalizeTaskReturningThunk` is where we call
`OnCompleted`, this means that user code gets called after we have
restored contexts.

To fix the issue change the thunks to look approximately like
```csharp
ExecutionAndSyncBlockStore store = default;
store.Push();
try
{
  Continuation cont;
  try
  {
    T result = Inner(args);
    cont = StubHelpers.AsyncCallContinuation();

  }
  catch (Exception ex)
  {
    return Task.FromException(ex);

* Remove forced reporting of EH code from stack frame iterator, as we
  now cannot have that code on the stack during 2nd pass

* [mono] Actually free dynamic methods, even if we have profiler attached

Ever since the early days of mono, freeing dynamic methods was disabled if a profiler was attached. The reason for this was probably that the profiler might store `MonoMethod` instances in its own data, leading to problems if we free those instances. Looking at the profilers nowadays it is not clear where patterns like this would happen. Profilers that do store methods (like aot, coverage), don't process wrapper methods, so we should be safe since dynamic methods have the MONO_WRAPPER_DYNAMIC_METHOD wrapper type.

The problem is that, nowadays, we can always have a profiler attached even if no actual profiling happens. macios for example always calls mono_profiler_install. I belive actual callbacks can be added later as necessary.

var param = lambda.Compile().Method.GetParameters()[0];
param.Name == null  // true

// Mono behavior (bug)
param.Name == """"    //  empty string, not null
```

ASP.NET Core validation checks `if (parameter.Name is null)` - this
works on CoreCLR but fails on Mono.

## Reproduction

```csharp
using System;
using System.Linq.Expressions;

var unnamed = Expression.Parameter(typeof(int));
var lambda = Expression.Lambda(Expression.Block(), unnamed);
var param = lambda.Compile().Method.GetParameters()[0];

// CoreCLR: param.Name is null 
// Mono: param.Name is """" 
Console.WriteLine($""Name is null: {param.Name is null}"");
```


**Test Results:**
- With only `loader.c` fix:  `param.Name` still returns `""""`
- With both fixes: `param.Name` correctly returns `null`






### Why 

`ParameterInfo.Name` is nullable (`string?`) per [API
Contract](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.parameterinfo.name?view=net-9.0&viewFallbackFrom=net-9.0))

cc: @giritrivedi",1,6,2,"[mono] actually free dynamic methods, even if we have profiler attached (issue_ref)* [mono] actually free dynamic methods, even if we have profiler attachedever since the early days of mono, freeing dynamic methods was disabled if a profiler was attached. the reason for this was probably that the profiler might store instances in its own data, leading to problems if we free those instances. looking at the profilers nowadays it is not clear where patterns like this would happen. profilers that do store methods (like aot, coverage), don't process wrapper methods, so we should be safe since dynamic methods have the mono_wrapper_dynamic_method wrapper type.the problem is that, nowadays, we can always have a profiler attached even if no actual profiling happens. macios for example always calls mono_profiler_install. i belive actual callbacks can be added later as necessary.* disable freeing dynamic methods only when eventpipe or debugger are enabled"

Our analysis framework is designed for analyzing parameters of methods
(since it's analyzing based on IL semantics), but the Roslyn operation
visitor gives us an operation block for the parameter initializers of
properties (indexers). These appear like any other operation block, and
don't seem to provide a way to short-circuit the analysis early.

This fixes the issue at the leaf when we visit a parameter reference
that's not owned by a method. In this case it doesn't make sense to look
for the associated getter/setter because the assignment operation is on
the property declaration and has no direct equivalent in IL.

dotnet/runtime,89e200ab566481d4e1e83d2cd40d0b958db7af2d,"Simplify ComInterfaceGenerator's Initialize() method (#119360)

The ComInterfaceGenerator takes a significant amount of time in its Initialize() method setting up an elaborate pipeline, even for compilations that don't use generated COM interfaces. In particular, it spent a lot of time in the series of Zip that preceded writing the source out. This PR reduces the number of incremental steps the generator creates, reducing the Initialize() time for projects that don't need the generator. This will likely reduce incremental performance slightly, but the tradeoff seems worth it considering the vast majority of projects won't need this generator.

The change moves all steps in the pipeline preceding the creation of the IncrementalMethodStubGenerationContext to a single step. It also moves the generation of all syntaxes into a single step rather than creating them in parallel steps and Ziping them together. The ItemAndSyntaxes type is used to keep the InterfaceContext (which is required in the source-writing step) in the collection so it doesn't need to be re-zipped in before writing out.

After this change, there are a number of other simplifications we can make (we don't need so many intermediate steps within the first step, the DiagnosticOr concept can be simplified) that I'd like to add in follow-up PRs.

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/119113 by adding a new
warning that is shown by the Roslyn analyzer when attempting to
annotate an extension property with
DynamicallyAccessedMembersAttribute.

The warning is also produced by ILLink and ILC, but only when the
compiler-generated extension metadata type (which contains the
property in IL) is referenced, for example via reflection or when the
assembly is rooted. So in practice this will be caught just by the
analyzer.

See comments in the code that explain some nuances of the test
approach (we need a way to assert `ExpectedWarning`s on the extension
properties, but not the compiler-generated methods in the extension
metadata type).

Testing this uncovered a test bug which was hiding

Reduce the number of type loads triggered by complex generic constraints. Experiments show about a 20% reduction in startup time on a proxy of the AWS lambda scenario.

The fixes are:
1. When a method/type has constraints, do not load the constraint types directly if they are generic interfaces. Instead, do accessibility checking and the constraint validation on the signature of the constraint instead.
2. When a type is loaded, enhance the special marker type optimization in the interface map to allow Interfaces which require implementation of other interfaces to use the special marker type. Notably, use the special marker type so that if a generic interface's first type parameter is used as all of the generic type parameters of a required interface we use the special marker type to indicate that the type is loaded.
    - This also forces us to have a somewhat more complicated implementation of casting, since the previous model of special marker types could not experience an equivalent interface match
3. When resolving a default interface method, attempt to avoid loading all the interface types associated with a type. Do so by changing the iteration of interfaces to check to see if the approximate interface could possibly have an implementation
4. When resolving a static virtual method, attempt to avoid loading all the types of the MethodImpl records. Do so by doing a Method name check before loading the type.

In addition, fix a test so that it still throws when loading an invalid type. This required adding a path which forced the interface type to be loaded.

As part of testing this work, the lack of generic variable type safety checks was noticed in crossgen2, and the following changes were made
- Add support for doing circularity checks on type and method generic parameters to the TypeValidationChecker in crossgen2
- Add support for doing variance safety checks to the type loader in crossgen2

And in the runtime
- Remove the circularity of type variables checks happening in generic method load, as it is redundant
- Put all of the variance safety checks in the runtime under the SkipTypeValidation flag as crossgen2 can now do it reliably

Fixes https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/120792

This looks like some very old bug that was exposed by an unrelated
change in .NET 10.0

Basically, we have an assertion `obj->pMT == <cns_type>` we invoke
`optImpliedByTypeOfAssertions` to see if we can find some existing
assertion (anywhere) for `obj != null` so we can duplicate it into
current `ASSERT_TP& activeAssertions`, because `obj->pMT` assertion
implies obj is not null.

We do find such an assertion but for some reason we don't check that
it's null on the right side (op2) -> obj != null. Instead, we pick up
some random `obj != <frozen_object>` assertion which then is incorrectly
used.

This change enables heap hard limit on 32 bit.

Approach is similar to `DOTNET_GCSegmentSize`
(`GCConfig::GetSegmentSize`), which allows to set size of segment for
SOH/LOH/POH, and guarantees that there's no oveflow during computations
(for example, during `size_t initial_heap_size = soh_segment_size +
loh_segment_size + poh_segment_size;`). When `DOTNET_GCSegmentSize` is
set on 32bit, it's rounded down to power of 2, so largest possible value
of provided segment (SOH) is 2 Gb (`4Mb<=soh_segment_size<=2Gb`). For
LOH/POH same value is divided by 2 and then also rounded down to power
of 2, so largest possible value of LOH/POH segment is 1 Gb
(`4Mb<=loh_segment_size<=1Gb, 0<=poh_segment_size<=1Gb`). So, segment
size for SOH/LOH/POH never overflows, as well as `initial_heap_size`
(except for oveflow of `initial_heap_size` to 0, which will lead to
failed allocation later anyway).

Similar thing happens when `DOTNET_GCHeapHardLimit` or
`DOTNET_GCHeapHardLimitSOH`/`DOTNET_GCHeapHardLimitLOH`/`DOTNET_GCHeapHardLimitPOH`
are set on 32bit. There're limits on these values:
1) for heap-specific limits:
`0 <= (heap_hard_limit = heap_hard_limit_oh[soh] +
heap_hard_limit_oh[loh] + heap_hard_limit_oh[poh]) < 4Gb`
`a) 0 <= heap_hard_limit_oh[soh] < 2Gb, 0 <= heap_hard_limit_oh[loh] <=
1Gb, 0 <= heap_hard_limit_oh[poh] <= 1Gb`
`b) 0 <= heap_hard_limit_oh[soh] <= 1Gb, 0 <= heap_hard_limit_oh[loh] <
2Gb, 0 <= heap_hard_limit_oh[poh] <= 1Gb`
`c) 0 <= heap_hard_limit_oh[soh] <= 1Gb, 0 <= heap_hard_limit_oh[loh] <=
1Gb, 0 <= heap_hard_limit_oh[poh] < 2Gb`
2) for same limit for all heaps:
  `0 <= heap_hard_limit <= 1Gb`

These ranges guarantee that calculation of soh_segment_size,
loh_segment_size and poh_segment_size with alignment and round up won't
overflow, as well as calculation of sum of them for allocation (overflow
to 0 is allowed, same as for `DOTNET_GCSegmentSize`). When values
specified by user with env variables don't meet the requirements above,
runtime exits with `CLR_E_GC_BAD_HARD_LIMIT`. When allocation (with
`mmap` on Linux) fails, runtime exits with same error as for large
segment size specified with `DOTNET_GCSegmentSize`.

This patch doesn't enable heap hard limit on 32bit in containers
(`is_restricted_physical_mem`), because current heap hard limit approach
is to reserve one large GC heap segment with size equal to specified
heap hard limit, and no new segments are reserved in future. On 64 bit
in containers by default heap hard limit is set to 75% of total physical
memory available, and this is fine, because virtual address space on 64
bit is much larger than actual physical size on devices. In contrast, on
32 bit virtual address space size might be the same as available
physical size on device (e.g. 4 Gb for both). This means that reserving
75% of total physical mem will reserve 75% of whole virtual address
space, which might be both undesirable (e.g. process later expects more
available memory) and `mmap` on Linux will probably fail anyway.

I've ran release CLR tests on armel Linux with this patch on top of
f84d33 with different limits, there seems to be no issues with
4Mb/8Mb/16Mb and 512Mb heap hard limits (some tests fail with ""Out of
memory""/""OOM"" and ""System.OutOfMemoryException"", as expected, or
""System.InvalidOperationException: NoGCRegion mode must be set"" when
NoGC region is larger than limit). Same for GCStresss 0xc and 0x3 with 4
Mb heap hard limit, and same for debug CLR tests on armel Linux with 4Mb
heap hard limit.

## Fix JsonSerializer.Deserialize for ReadOnlyMemory<T> and Memory<T> in
streaming scenarios

### Problem
When deserializing `ReadOnlyMemory<T>` or `Memory<T>` from a stream, the
converters incorrectly return early when resuming from continuation
state if the current token is null, treating it as a root-level null
instead of a null array element.

### Solution
Changed the null check in `OnTryRead` to use `state.Current.ObjectState
== StackFrameObjectState.None` instead of `!state.IsContinuation`. This
properly distinguishes between:
1. Initial call where root value is null (ObjectState.None) - should
return early with default
2. Resumption during array processing where reader is at a null element
(ObjectState != None) - should continue to base implementation

**Changes made:**
- **ReadOnlyMemoryConverter.cs**: Changed line 21 from `if
(reader.TokenType is JsonTokenType.Null && !state.IsContinuation)` to
`if (reader.TokenType is JsonTokenType.Null && state.Current.ObjectState
== StackFrameObjectState.None)`
- **MemoryConverter.cs**: Changed line 21 from `if (reader.TokenType is
JsonTokenType.Null && !state.IsContinuation)` to `if (reader.TokenType
is JsonTokenType.Null && state.Current.ObjectState ==
StackFrameObjectState.None)`
- **CollectionTests.Memory.cs**: Added two comprehensive regression
tests:
- `DeserializeReadOnlyMemoryFromStreamWithManyNulls`: Tests with 200
null elements and DefaultBufferSize=1
- `DeserializeMemoryFromStreamWithManyNulls`: Tests with 200 null
elements and DefaultBufferSize=1
  - Uses `Enumerable.Repeat` for clean test data generation

### Testing
- [x] All 49,800 System.Text.Json tests pass
- [x] New tests specifically validate the fix works with extreme buffer
constraints that force resumptions
- [x] Tests verify 200 consecutive nulls are correctly deserialized

### Technical Details

The fix uses `ObjectState == None` instead of `!IsContinuation` because:
- When `ObjectState == None`, we're at the very beginning before any
processing has started - a null token means the root value is null
- When `ObjectState != None`, we've already started processing the
collection - a null token is likely a null element in the array, not a
root-level null

This properly handles resumption at arbitrary reader positions during
streaming deserialization with small buffer sizes.

### Security Summary
No security vulnerabilities were introduced or discovered during this
change.

> Should we just not use {ReadOnly}Memory<T> as a deserialization
target? Is its usage some kind of an edge case that is not well tested?
I was under the impression that if I don't strictly need a `List<T>` or
`T[]`, deserializing a JSON file to `ReadOnlyMemory<T>` would have some
performance benefits (like allocating less) but it causing all these
issues for random JSON files makes me wonder whether I am missing a memo
where its usage is discouraged for JSON deserialization.
> 
> ### Reproduction Steps
> 
> 1. Run
[ReadOnlyMemoryDeserializationBug.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/23283516/ReadOnlyMemoryDeserializationBug.zip)
> 2. Notice it prints `Deserialization failed miserably!`
> 3. Change
`JsonSerializer.Deserialize<ReadOnlyMemory<NameRecord>>(fileStream)` to
`JsonSerializer.Deserialize<NameRecord[]>(fileStream)` and re-run it.
> 4. Notice it prints `Deserialization succeeded!`
> 
> ### Expected behavior
> 
> `JsonSerializer.Deserialize<ReadOnlyMemory<T>>` should be able to
deserialize everything `JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T[]>` can
deserialize.
> 
> ### Actual behavior
> 
> `JsonSerializer.Deserialize<ReadOnlyMemory<T>>` fails to deserialize
some JSON files that `JsonSerializer.Deserialize<T[]>` deserializes just
fine.
> 
> ### Regression?
> 
> Partially. For some JSON files .NET 8 does not fail but .NET 9 fails.
For some other JSON files .NET 8 fails with an (incorrect) exception but
.NET 9 fails silently. The attached repro project showcases where both
.NET versions fail.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toom%E2%80%93Cook_multiplication

I updated `BigInteger` multiplication to use the Toom-3 algorithm.

The current Karatsuba algorithm has a time complexity of
$O(n^{\log_2{3}}) \simeq O(n^{1.58})$, which is expected to improve to
$O(n^{\log_3{5}}) \simeq O(n^{1.46})$ resulting in better performance.

in other languages:
-
[OpenJDK](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/be900f1253fe130347385f0daec772c20a79ed57/src/java.base/share/classes/java/math/BigInteger.java#L1701-L1758)
-
[JavaScript-V8](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/7fdc2728f2114b083ebbd24710a32fe4574c0c57/src/bigint/mul-toom.cc)

## About the Implementation

- Merged `SquareThreshold` and `MultiplyKaratsubaThreshold`.
    - Since both had the same value, this improves testability.
- Added `{[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]` to avoid
stack consumption when determining the algorithm.
- In some cases, the Toom-2.5 algorithm is used.

### Why `MultiplyToom3Threshold` is 256?

Based on the benchmark results, I decided to set
`MultiplyToom3Threshold` to 256.

## Benchmark

When the number of digits is small, the preprocessing for algorithm
selection is relatively high, leading to a slight regression—for
example, a computation that previously took 19 μs now takes 20 μs.

However, as the number of digits increases, performance improves; for
instance, a multiplication that used to take 750 μs is now completed in
690 μs.

`timespec_get` is not available on the Android API levels we target,
causing compilation failures in debug builds of
`src/coreclr/utilcode/debug.cpp`.

### Changes
- Added `HOST_ANDROID` to the existing preprocessor conditionals that
select `gettimeofday` over `timespec_get`
- Updated include guards for `<sys/time.h>` to include Android

Android now follows the same codepath as iOS, tvOS, and macCatalyst:

```cpp
#if defined(HOST_IOS) || defined(HOST_TVOS) || defined(HOST_MACCATALYST) || defined(HOST_ANDROID)
    // timespec_get is only available on iOS 13.0+ and not supported on Android API levels we target
    struct timeval tv;
    gettimeofday(&tv, nullptr);
    ts.tv_sec = tv.tv_sec;
    ts.tv_nsec = tv.tv_usec * 1000;
#else
    int ret = timespec_get(&ts, TIME_UTC);
#endif
```

<summary>Original prompt</summary>

> When built for Android in the debug configuration,
src/coreclr/utilcode/debug.cpp fails to compile because timespec_get is
not supported for the API level we target. HOST_ANDROID needs to be
added to #define checks so that it will fall through the gettimeofday
path.
